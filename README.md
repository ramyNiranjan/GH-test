# Starwar-info
### This app is bootstrap by `creat-react-app`.  
##### I already build a app using star war API 
but here i showcase how to use [ReactQuery](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).  
React-query is great tool to manage server data, which manage fetch,cache, revalidating,updating and many more out of box solutions.  
Tailwind other hand easy to use utility first css framwork, which often describe as api for styling.
